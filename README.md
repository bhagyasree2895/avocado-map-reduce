#### Course Description: Design and implementation of data intensive systems covering common approaches to processing big data at rest and data in motion. Using MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters. An introduction to the design of data-intensive, reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems. This may include concepts such as parallel programming, distributed computing, distributed file systems, MapReduce, regular expressions, and the ingesting and processing of data at-rest and data in motion. Tools used may include Hadoop, HDFS, Pig, Hive, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Mahout, MLlib, etc

The dataset we choose is Avocado prices and want to see prices of avocado in each region of united states.

## Introduction: 
##### It's also a well known fact that all Millenials live in their parents basements. Clearly, they aren't buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast! The main reason we took this dataset is for knowing how much volume of avocados are consumed.

## Data Source:
#### link to Actual data source: https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices
     - This data-set of Avocado Prices has 14 columns and nearly 20,000 rows. 
     - The data is scraped in the csv file. 
     - The data-set which I took is structured data which is in the Excel format. 
     - The volume of the data is around 2 MB. 
     - The velocity of this data-set is pretty slow, since it's just the information recorded once for the year for each country. 
     - The data is not messy and  clean.
## Requirements:
     - Install python3 version
     - Install visual studio code
     - Install power shell
     - Install MS Excel
## Sequence of steps for execution:
     - Select a structured data set from https://www.kaggle.com which is in csv format.
     - Make sure python is installed using command prompt using command: python
     - Create mapper and reducer python files for each problem and write relevant code into them.
     - In a developer folder open powershell here as administrator.
     - In powershell write command : python mapper.py
     - After running mapper.py, run reducer.py file using command: python reducer.py
     - Solution for the problem will be saved in reducerout.txt file.
     - Copy the text from the reducerout.txt file and paste it in excel sheet.
     - Select the data in excel sheet and go to insert to generate graph or chart.
     - Select a best suitable graph type and generate the graph for the corresponding data.

## Big Data problems:

### Bhagya Sree Chanda:
#### Problem: For each country, find the maximum voume of consumed volume of avocado
##### - Mapper input: 0	12/27/2015	1.33	64236.62	1036.74	54454.85	48.16	8696.87	8603.62	93.25	0	conventional	2015	Albany
##### - Mapper output: Key is Country (Albany): Value is total volume(64236.62)
              - Albany 64236.62
              - Albany 54876.98
              - Albany 118220.22
              - Albany 78992.15
              - Albany 51039.6
##### - Reducer output: Key is Country (Albany): Value is total volume(118220.22) {here the value as volume would be maximum of all volumes for a particular country(Albany)
              - Albany 118220.2

### Nikitha Lakmarapu: 
#### Problem: For each country, find the sum of consumed volume of avocado.
##### - Mapper input: 0	12/27/2015	1.33	64236.62	1036.74	54454.85	48.16	8696.87	8603.62	93.25	0	conventional	2015	Albany
##### - Mapper output: Key is Country (Albany): Value is total volume(64236.62)
              - Albany 64236.62
              - Albany 54876.98
              - Albany 118220.22
              - Albany 78992.15
              - Albany 51039.6
##### - Reducer output: Key is Country (Albany): Value is total volume(367365.57) {here the value as volume would be sum of all volumes for a particular country(Albany)
              - Albany 367365.57
